            Recognizing the needs of diverse students in online courses, I conducted a remote usability test on Eastern Washington University's online learning platform Canvas to give instructors the information they need to create a usable and accessible online course for all students.

          As students moved online, it became increasingly important for
          instructors' course materials and designs in Canvas to be accessible
          and usable for all students. With so many diverse students who were
          struggling, it was clear that instructors needed to know their
          students' struggles to know how to revise their courses.

      <p>The recommendations helped EWU and instructors pinpoint where their students were struggling, which was the need for mechanical instructions in Canvas. It also shed light on the need for the university to provide trainings to instructors to support their journey on creating accessible and usable courses for their students.</p>

      <h3>Final Takeaways</h3>
    </div>

    <section class="project-takeaway">
      <p> I enjoyed and learned a lot from being a UX researcher as it was inspiring to learn more about how a product can shape the experience that people, especially diverse people, encounter and their importance in being included in the design and research process. Empathy, curiosity, and inclusion are key to empathizing with others on a deeper level and in making a product that is truly accessible for everyone. With these elements, I have learned how to create meaningful relationships with my users and stakeholders which lead to an inclusive, elevated, and supportive community and product.</p>
