            How-To Bamboo's user interface is clean and easy to navigate with
            accessibility features of languages and read-aloud audio included.
            Navigating through long articles has never been easier with table of
            contents and return to the top features included. This simple but
            fluid how-to app has increased the usability for many diverse and
            general audiences.

          To understand what needed to be improved, I analyzed the WikiHow app
          and website for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
          (SWOT analysis). Through this analysis, I was able to begin
          redesigning with specific goals.

          <li>
            Information and navigation needs to be reorganized and restructured.

          <li>The search bar should be easier to find.</li>
          <li>
            The app supports WikiHow's diverse audience through accessbile
            design: language, privacy, and display options.

        To determine which re-design iteration works best for users, I created

        conducted yet but I am excited to continue learning about this
        methodology and do the study in the future.

      <h3>Final Takeaways</h3>

    <section class="project-takeaway">
      <p>
        This was a great challenge as it brought me on the path to designing for
        mobile apps, so quite a few lessons were learned. I began involving
        diverse audiences and accessible features in my designs which has been a
        journey of learning about their diverse needs. I also began
        understanding the constraints of creating an app and the layout, which
        both need thoughtful consideration for all users in order for a great
        experience to be had.
