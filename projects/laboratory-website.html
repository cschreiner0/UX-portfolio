          To understand what needed to be improved, we met with the client to understand their organization's needs and as a team, we evaluated their current website.  <b>I organized weekly team meetings</b> to split the workload for optimized work efficiently and track weekly progress. The first task my teammate and I did was <b>conduct user research</b> through SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) and contextual inquiry.
         Through this analysis, we were able to begin
          redesigning with specific goals.

        <ul>
          <li>
              <b>Easy to update</b> – Residents and events are going in and out frequently.
          </li>
          <li><b>Showcases Resident Work</b> – From the past, and present throughout the entire website with captions. </li>
          <li>
            <b>Identify a Visual Identity</b> – Professional for visitors, but inspirational and artist centered.
          </li>
          <li><b>Easy to Navigate</b> – All sections are easy to find and have meaning. Content of each is understandable relatively quickly before going into depth.
            </li>
          <li><b>Information sorted well for different audiences</b> – Administration, resident artists, collaborators, curators, donators, community. Draws all of them in.
            </li>
          <li><b>Organized</b> – Past residents and their history, current residents and their info, events, staff, etc.

          <p>We combined the art direction and wireframing to create a working prototype. I sent to prototype to the client for feedback and we revised it to meet their needs while keeping the constraints of the users' needs. Currently we are in the process of coding the basic website and then work with web developers to complete the website.  </p>

      <h3>Final Takeaways</h3>
    </div>

    <section class="project-takeaway">
      <p>
          Working with UX designers, web developers, and Laboratory Residency Spokane was a great experience as it brought me further down the path to designing and coding for websites. Leading weekly meetings and regularly contacting the client with questions and updates on our progress was a learning experience that was a little nerve wracking but also confidence inducing. I also learned how to be a UX designer and researcher that works on all sections of the process, including working with web developers which was a newer experience for me. I thoroughly enjoyed working with Laboratory and my teammates and expect to further build upon these skills with future teammates and clientele.
